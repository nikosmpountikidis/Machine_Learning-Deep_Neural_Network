# Machine_Learning-Deep_Neural_Network
 
This is a project for the course Neural Networks-Deep learning of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. I used the MNIST dataset to implement K-Nearest Neighbor, Nearest Class Centroid, Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine and Radial Basis Function
